# Safety First

Before you automate anything, read this page. It takes two minutes and it will
save you from headaches later.

## The golden rules

1. **Test on copies, never move originals.** Every script in this handbook
   works on a copy of your files by default. Run it on a test folder first.
   Only point it at your real files once you're sure it does what you expect.
2. **Never move originals unless you explicitly ask.** The scripts are written
   to copy or leave files in place by default. Moving or deleting is something
   you opt into, never something that happens by accident.
3. **You can read every script.** These are tiny Python scripts (under 100
   lines each). Open them, read them, and only run them when you understand
   what they do.
4. **Start small.** Automate one folder, one afternoon. Don't try to organize
   your whole computer in one sitting.

## Why we test on copies

If a script has a bug, you want it to scramble a test folder, not your only
copy of last year's tax documents. A copy costs nothing; your originals are
irreplaceable.

## How to make a test copy

On Windows, copy your Downloads folder to a folder called `Downloads Test`.
On Mac, right-click and Duplicate. On Linux, `cp -r Downloads Downloads-Test`.

Point the script at `Downloads Test` first. Check the results. Then decide
whether to run it on the real `Downloads`.

## What these scripts do NOT do

- They do not send your files anywhere. Everything stays on your computer.
- They do not require an internet connection (except the webpage-saver, which
  downloads the page you ask it to).
- They do not need API keys, accounts, or personal information.
- They do not delete anything unless you explicitly opt in.

If a script ever asks for something that makes you uncomfortable, stop and
read the source. You're in control.
